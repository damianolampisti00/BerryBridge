**Berry Bridge** is a native unofficial Beeper client for rooted BlackBerry 10 devices that synchronizes your messaging accounts via the Beeper Desktop API.

## 🍴 About this fork

This is a fork of [adem-zengin/BerryBridge](https://github.com/adem-zengin/BerryBridge) with a few additions. It installs as a separate app (**Berry Bridge**, package `it.berrybridge.app`, data in `shared/misc/BerryBridge`), so it can sit next to the original; uninstall the original once this one works, or you will get every notification twice.

What it adds:

- **Notifications with Instant Preview**, and tapping a notification opens that chat (the original's notification invoke target pointed to a non-existent app).
- **Profile pictures** for direct and group chats, fetched through Beeper Desktop's `/v1/assets/serve` and cached as small thumbnails. This also fixes the stored participant list of direct chats, which was unreadable (`JsonDataAccess::saveToBuffer` appends to the string it is given).
- **Dark theme** (WhatsApp-like palette), selectable in **Settings > Dark theme** and applied right away; the light theme keeps the original colors.
- **Voice messages without BerryCore**: received voice notes play inside the chat (Ogg/Opus decoded on the phone), and you can record and send your own (with an empty text field the send button becomes a microphone). Recording uses the phone's voice-recording audio path with the driver's mmap mode off, which removes the crackling it otherwise produces.
- **WhatsApp voice calls** (experimental, see [below](#-whatsapp-calls-experimental)): incoming and outgoing 1:1 calls with a call screen, through a WaCalls server.
- **Active Frame**: the minimized app shows each account with its unread messages (archived chats left out, muted ones counted and said).
- **Safer settings**: the sync cursor and the new-message flags, which the app and its service both rewrite all the time, moved out of the main settings file; sharing it could empty it (server, token and accounts lost).
- **`package.ps1`**: builds the app and its service from the command line into one `.bar`, and can install it on a rooted phone over SSH (`-Install`; set `$PhoneIp`/`$RootKey` in `package.config.ps1`, see `package.config.example.ps1`). It needs the BlackBerry 10 Native SDK 10.3 in `C:bndk` and Git for Windows.

## 📞 WhatsApp calls (experimental)

Berry Bridge can make and receive **WhatsApp voice calls** on the BlackBerry. Beeper doesn't carry calls, so they go through [WaCalls](https://github.com/JotaDev66/WaCalls), a server that implements WhatsApp's VoIP stack (signaling, MLow codec, SRTP relays) on top of whatsmeow, plus a small **Berry Bridge gateway** added to it in [damianolampisti00/WaCalls](https://github.com/damianolampisti00/WaCalls#berry-bridge-gateway-blackberry-10) (`cmd/server/bbgateway.go`). The phone stays a plain audio terminal: it only moves 16 kHz PCM and simple JSON commands over one TLS WebSocket.

```
WhatsApp <-> WaCalls (linked device of your account) <-> gateway (wss, token) <-> Berry Bridge service <-> mic / earpiece / speaker
```

- **Incoming calls**: the call screen comes up with *Rispondi* / *Rifiuta*, plus a Hub notification (and a missed-call one if you don't answer). The call also rings on your main phone, as on any linked device.
- **Outgoing calls**: *Chiama* in the title bar of WhatsApp one-to-one chats (the number comes from Beeper's participant list).
- **In a call**: timer, mute, speaker/earpiece, hang up. The call lives in the headless service, so hiding the screen or closing the app doesn't end it.
- **Audio**: 16 kHz mono PCM both ways, 20 ms blocks up, a jitter buffer down, the system's voice audio path; the gateway levels the peer's voice. About 10% CPU on a Q10. The certificate of the gateway is verified.

Setup:

1. Run [the WaCalls fork](https://github.com/damianolampisti00/WaCalls) with the gateway on its own listener and a random token (16+ characters) in a file, e.g. `wacalls -addr 127.0.0.1:8097 -bb-addr 127.0.0.1:8098 -bb-token-file bb_token`, and pair it with your WhatsApp (QR, *Linked devices*). Keep the WaCalls API itself on localhost: it has no authentication.
2. Expose only the gateway, over HTTPS (for example a Cloudflare tunnel to `localhost:8098`; HTTP/2 transport is the safer choice for a long-lived audio stream).
3. In Berry Bridge **Settings**: *Calls server* `wss://your-host/ws` and *Calls token*. The status line below them shows the link state.

Not done yet: echo cancellation on the speakerphone (use the earpiece, or a headset), video calls, group calls.

For development, `package.ps1 -DevTools` adds a call-audio test harness and debug logs in the shared folder. Never use it for builds you give to others: those files are reachable by other apps.

Credits: Berry Bridge by Adem Zengin (MIT, see `LICENSE`); the Ogg/Opus encoder and decoder come from BBport; libopus is BSD-licensed (`third_party/opus/COPYING`); calls rely on WaCalls by JotaDev66 (MIT) and whatsmeow.

## ☁️ Option 2: Free Cloud Server Setup (Global Access)

To access your messages outside your local network without keeping a home PC constantly running, you can host Beeper Desktop on a free cloud server (e.g., Oracle Cloud Always Free).

### 1. Create an Oracle Cloud VM
1. Sign up for a free **Oracle Cloud** account.
2. Create a Virtual Machine (VM) eligible under the **Always Free** tier (e.g., Ubuntu ARM64).
3. **Save your SSH private key** during instance creation.
4. Once created, note down your server's **Public IP Address**.

### 2. Open Ports in Oracle Cloud VCN Security Rules
1. Go to **Instances** > Click on your instance name.
2. Under **Instance details**, click on your **Virtual Cloud Network (VCN)**.
3. Select **Subnets** > Click on your subnet.
4. Click on the **Default Security List**.
5. Under **Ingress Rules**, click **Add Ingress Rules**.
6. Add rules allowing incoming TCP traffic on ports **`80`**, **`443`**, and **`3389`**.

### 3. Server Configuration over SSH
Connect to your server via SSH (e.g., using Terminal or PuTTY):

```bash
ssh -i /path/to/your_private_key.key ubuntu@YOUR_PUBLIC_IP
```

Set a password for the `ubuntu` user:
```bash
sudo passwd ubuntu
```

Install the XFCE desktop environment, XRDP (Remote Desktop), and Firefox:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install xfce4 xfce4-goodies xrdp firefox -y
echo "xfce4-session" > ~/.xsession
sudo systemctl restart xrdp
```

Open system firewall ports:
```bash
sudo iptables -I INPUT -p tcp -m multiport --dports 80,443,3389 -j ACCEPT
sudo netfilter-persistent save
```

### 4. Dynamic DNS & SSL Certificate Setup
1. Register a free domain/hostname (e.g., via [DuckDNS](https://www.duckdns.org/)) and point it to your server's **Public IP Address**.
2. Install Nginx and Certbot:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install nano nginx certbot python3-certbot-nginx -y
   ```
3. Generate an SSL certificate:
   ```bash
   sudo certbot certonly --nginx -d YOUR_DOMAIN.duckdns.org --key-type rsa
   ```

### 5. Configure Nginx Reverse Proxy
Create the Nginx configuration file:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/beeper
```

Paste the following configuration (replace `YOUR_DOMAIN.duckdns.org` with your actual domain):

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name YOUR_DOMAIN.duckdns.org;

    client_max_body_size 500M;

    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/YOUR_DOMAIN.duckdns.org/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/YOUR_DOMAIN.duckdns.org/privkey.pem;

    ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
    ssl_ciphers 'ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:@SECLEVEL=0';
    access_log /var/log/nginx/beeper_access.log ssl_verbose;
    error_log /var/log/nginx/beeper_error.log info;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:23373;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;

        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";

        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

        proxy_read_timeout 86400s;
        proxy_send_timeout 86400s;
    }
}
```

Enable the site configuration and restart Nginx:
```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/beeper /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo rm -f /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

### 6. Connect via RDP & Install Beeper Desktop
1. Launch **Remote Desktop Connection** on your PC.
2. Connect to your server's **Public IP Address**.
3. Log in with Username: `ubuntu` and the password set earlier.
4. Open **Firefox** inside the remote desktop session.
